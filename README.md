# Mullvad-Renamer

Mullvad's WireGuard config generator does not include server location names, which is a hassle if you want import everything. This Python script renames the configurations to include the location.

The new file name will have the format of `mv-COUNTRYcity-server.conf`, where COUNTRY is the two digit country code and city is the city name truncated to five characters. This is because WireGuard has a 15 character limit and I feel this format still captures enough info to pick which server location to use.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6+

## Steps

1. Save the Mullvad WireGuard server page in your browser. Unfortunately, the server table is generated by a script so it would be a hassle to auto download that in the script.
2. After downloading the zipped configs from Mullvad, extract.
3. Set `HTML_PATH` and `CONFIG_PATH` in the script to the path.  If you saved the page and extracted files to the same folder as the script, the settings should be fine as is.
4. Run `pip install BeautifulSoup pycountry unidecode`.
5. Run `python mullvad-renamer.py` and follow the instructions.
